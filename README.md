Arduino

LED with current limiting resistor
LED with push button to drop potential and control on/off
LED with LDR replacing button
Control using a transistor to control a light bulb

Big project â€“ 2 wheel drive robot with independent motors controlled by transistors dependent on LDRs with light detection and flashlights.

Basically, make the circuit control whether the motor turns on based on an LDR. This enables two types of robot behaviour to introduce more complex programming. Either the robot can seek light or it can avoid light. This will take a while to do and will be the first evaluation.
